If you are using VSCode "Live Server" extension, create a .vscode folder in the root of the project. Inside, create a settings.json and paste following code:
{
    "liveServer.settings.https": {
        "enable": true, //set it true to enable the feature.
        "cert": "C:\\nginx\\ssl\\localhost.pem", // full path of the certificate
        "key": "C:\\nginx\\ssl\\localhost.key", // full path of the private key
        "passphrase": ""
    }
}


To get live server certificates (when hosting):
1. Go to your hosting provider and open the CPanel.
2. Click "SSL/TLS Status"
3. Find the domain and select "View SSL certificate"
4. Scroll down and you shall find the CRT, KEY and CABUNDLE fields.
5. Create the following files and place them inside nginx/ssl/.

File names must be the same as the domain:
exampledomain.com.pem - Certificate (CRT) + CA bundle // Copy-Paste the CRT and then on a new line Copy-Paste CA BUNDLE. If the bundle is not added, woocommerce hooks wont recognize the SSL certificate for some reason
exampledomain.com.key - Private key (KEY)

or subdomain.example.com.pem ....
