Server:

1. Add euroConversionDone = false to all products and orders in the database to track which ones have been converted (through MongoDB Compass).

1. In the generateDescription function in server/controllers/products.js, delete the BGN and uncomment the EUR part of the code so the new descriptions have the EURO sign in them.

2. Run the convertBGNtoEUR function from server/functions/dev.js 

3. Once all products prices are converted, the function can be deleted from the codebase.

4. Delete the 'euroConversionDone' field from the product model in server/models/product.js and from db.

5. Delete the 'euroConversionDone' field from the order model in server/models/order.js and from db.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Frontend (WHILE BOTH BGN AND EURO MUST BE DISPLAYED):

1. In src/api.js, in the formatPrice function, change the 'euro = false' to 'euro = true' so that prices are displayed in EURO by default.

2. Find all functions that have 'euro = true' and change them to 'euro = false' so that BGN is also displayed (orders, printer, etc.). Use this regex to find them:
formatPrice\(.+true\)

3. Find and replace functions BGNtoEuro with EuroToBGN to convert prices back to BGN for display.

WooCommerce
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
1. After updating everything on Server, run the script to batch update all products in woocommerce. That will update the price and the description.

2. Change the default currency in WooCommerce settings from BGN to EURO in https://emo-sklad.bg/wp-admin/admin.php?page=wc-settings under "General"/"Currency".

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Frontend (AFTER BGN IS NO LONGER NEEDED):

1. In src/api.js, in the formatPrice function, remove the euro parameter and always return euro.

2. Find all functions that use the euro parameter and remove it/them. Use this regex to find them:
formatPrice\(.+false\)

3. Find any function that may return both BGN/EURO

4. Delete the BGNtoEuro function from src/api.js.
